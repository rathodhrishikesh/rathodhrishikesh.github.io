				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>An Equity Linked Note (ELN) is a structured financial instrument provided by financial institutions to investors, offering a distinctive mix of investment attributes. It is typically issued at a reduced cost compared to the principal amount.</li>
				<li>The gap between the payment made by investors and the amount obtained at maturity constitutes the investor's gain, and is shown as the annualized yield.</li>
				<li>Should the underlying stock price stay at or above the Strike Price on the Valuation Date, investors receive the full Principal Amount upon maturity.</li>
				<li>If the underlying stock performs under the Strike Price, investors are susceptible to the stock's unfavorable performance.</li>
				<li><b>Python</b> was a suitable choice for implementing this project due to its versatility, robust libraries for financial modeling and analysis, and ease of implementing complex calculations and simulations for Equity Linked Notes (ELNs).</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Methodology</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Conceptual Understanding:</strong> Reviewed and refreshed the core concepts of Equity Linked Notes (ELNs), focusing on key aspects like reduced issuance price, Valuation Date, Strike Price, and calucation of investment outcome in various scenarios.</li>
					<li><strong>Data Gathering:</strong> Collected relevant historical data of underlying stock prices leading up to the Valuation Date, ensuring data accuracy and relevance.</li>
					<li><strong>Scenario Modeling:</strong> Developed a Python script to simulate diverse ELN scenarios, incorporating varying movements of the underlying stock prices.</li>
					<li><strong>Analysis and Communication:</strong> Calculated annualized yield for each scenario, analyze the impact of stock price variations, and prepare a succinct report or presentation to convey methodology, outcomes, and insights effectively.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Concepts Learned</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Structured Products:</b> Gained an in-depth understanding of Equity Linked Notes (ELNs) as a type of financial strutured product and their unique risk-return characteristics.</li>
					<li><b>Risk Management:</b> Explored how ELNs can act as risk management tools for investors by offering potential gains while managing exposure to unfavorable stock performance.</li>
					<li><b>Valuation and Maturity:</b> Learned the significance of Valuation Dates and Maturity in the context of ELNs, and how these influence investor payouts.</li>
					<li><b>Yield Calculation:</b> Understood the calculation of annualized yield as a measure of an ELN's attractiveness and profitability, enhancing financial analysis skills.</li>
					<li><b>Matplotlib:</b> Acquired graph plotting skills, enhancing visualization capabilities.</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="section" id="results" style="flex: 1; margin: 10px;">
				<h3>Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Successfully built Python-based simulations to model ELN scenarios under varying stock price conditions.</li>
					<li>Generated comprehensive visualizations depicting ELN performance, making it easier to communicate potential outcomes to stakeholders.</li>
					<li>Calculated and presented annualized yield based on simulated scenarios, providing valuable insights for investors.</li>
					<li>Provided clear comparisons between scenarios where underlying stock price is above and below the Strike Price, aiding decision-making.</li>
					<li>The <b>"ELN Financial Outcome Evaluator"</b> tool helps an investor to determine the outcome of the structured product investment, on the basis of parameters like Strike Price and Issuer Price.</li>
